## **Install Rust**

_**Why?** Rust is the language Solana uses to build programs._

[Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is as simple as running this.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

When installed, it will add the following PATH — or similar — to your shell configurations which is good to know if you want to move that to your dotfiles or something.

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

You can check that rust is properly installed by running the following commands.

```shell
rustup --version
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
